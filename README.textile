h2. What is this project ?

This *buji-oauth-demo* project is a demo webapp to test OAuth client support for Shiro based on the "buji-oauth":https://github.com/bujiio/buji-oauth extension  *version >= 1.1.0* (and the "scribe-up":https://github.com/leleuj/scribe-up library).
The web app is protected with the shiro & buji-oauth libraries : when a user tries to access a protected area, he's redirected to a specified OAuth provider (like Facebook, Twitter...) to log in and send back to the application after successfull authentication, authenticated and with a complete user profile.

If you want to use *Guice*, please see the "buji-guice-demo":https://github.com/vonZeppelin/buji-guice-demo.
