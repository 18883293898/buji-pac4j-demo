h2. What is this project ?

This *scribe-up-shiro-demo* project is a demo webapp to test OAuth client support for Shiro based on the "buji-oauth":https://github.com/bujiio/buji-oauth extension (and the "scribe-up":https://github.com/leleuj/scribe-up library).
The web app is protected with the shiro & buji-oauth libraries : when a user tries to access a protected area, he's redirected to a specified OAuth provider (like Facebook, Twitter...) to log in and send back to the application after successfull authentication, authenticated and with a complete user profile.
